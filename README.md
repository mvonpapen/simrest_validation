Simulation of resting state activity in macaque cortex and its validation with respect to experimental data

This git repository is dedicated to the validation of models of resting state activity in cortex by comparison of simulation results to experimental recordings.

 

This project is also intended as a proof of concept implementation of a general workflow, using HBP tools, for comparison of electrophysiolocial and simulated data.
